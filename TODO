This is my todolist not for stuff I actually need to do, but for stuff I just don't want to forget:
    -Make delete work from feeds
    -Add reading feed folder
    -Make alerts look good
    -Add renaming
    -Make inputs look good (don't have them just be popups at the top of the page, put them in the middle)
    -Add pop ups for reading the articles
    -Add caching of feeds in DB
    -Secure db
    -Make logo
    -Make settings page look nice
